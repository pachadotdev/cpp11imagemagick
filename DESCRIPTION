Description: Bindings to 'ImageMagick':
    The most comprehensive open-source image processing library available.
    Supports many common formats (png, jpeg, tiff, pdf, etc) and manipulations
    (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip, blur, etc). All operations are vectorized
    via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate either on a single frame or a
    series of frames for working with layers, collages, or animation. In
    RStudio, the images are automatically previewed when printed to the console,
    resulting in an interactive editing environment. Includes a native graphics
    device for creating  in-memory graphics or drawing onto images using pixel
    coordinates.
